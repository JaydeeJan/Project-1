## Load Data
```{r}
tournament_data <- readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JaydeeJan/Project-1/refs/heads/main/tournamentinfo.txt")

head(tournament_data, 20)
tail(tournament_data, 20)

```
## Extract Player Information 
```{r}

# Function to extract player information using regular expressions

extract_player_info <- function(player_lines, tournament_data) {
  player_name <- str_trim(str_match(player_lines[1], "\\|\\s*([A-Z\\s]+)\\s*\\|")[2])
  player_state <- str_trim(str_match(player_lines[2], "\\s*([A-Z]{2})\\s*\\|")[2])

  opponents <- unlist(str_match_all(player_lines[1], "[WLDB]\\s*(\\d+)"))
  
  opponent_ratings <- c()
  for (opponent in opponents) {
    # Find the opponent's entry by looking for the line starting with the opponent's number
    opp_start_line <- grep(paste0("^\\s*", opponent, "\\s*\\|"), tournament_data)
    if (length(opp_start_line) > 0) {
      # Extract the pre-rating of the opponent
      opp_line <- tournament_data[opp_start_line + 1] # Rating is in the line below
      opp_rating <- as.numeric(str_trim(str_match(opp_line, "R:\\s*([0-9]+)")[2]))
      if (!is.na(opp_rating)) {

      }
    }
  }
  
  # Calculate the average opponent rating

  # Return the extracted info as a data frame row
  data.frame(
    PlayerName = player_name,
    PlayerState = player_state,
    TotalPoints = total_points,
    PlayerPreRating = pre_rating,
    AvgOppRating = round(avg_opp_rating, 0)
  )
}

```

## Initialize Data Frame To Store The Result
```{r}
results <- data.frame(PlayerName = character(), PlayerState = character(),
                      TotalPoints = numeric(), PlayerPreRating = numeric(), AvgOppRating = numeric())

# Loop through the data and extract information for each player
player_start_lines <- grep("^\\s+\\d+\\s*\\|", tournament_data)

for (i in seq_along(player_start_lines)) {
  # Each player block consists of two consecutive lines
  player_lines <- tournament_data[player_start_lines[i]:(player_start_lines[i] + 1)]
  # Extract player info and add it to the results data frame
  player_info <- extract_player_info(player_lines, tournament_data)
  results <- rbind(results, player_info)
}

# Show the resulting data frame
head(results, 10)
tail(results, 10)

```

## Generates the result to .CSV file
```{r}
write.csv(results, file = "tournament_results.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
